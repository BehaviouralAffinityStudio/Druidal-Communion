... CODE QUALITY<br /> 
... ... End of the third semester studying programmation<br />

... DESIGN LOGIC<br /> 
... ... The goal was to create a functional and interesting AI to fight against<br /> 
... ... ... The game is basically 4 shrines which spawn various amount of enemies from the two available types of enemy<br /> 
... ... ... ... Every shrine must be "restored" by interacting with them for N seconds to "win" the game.<br />
